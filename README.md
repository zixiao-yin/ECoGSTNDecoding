# ECoGSTNDecoding
Next-generation neurotechnologies can sense brain activity to guide assistive brain computer interfaces or adapt closed-loop neuromodulation therapies in response to circuit and symptom changes. Most invasive neuromodulation targets reside in the depth of the brain, oftentimes comprising small neural structures that give rise to symptoms and disease specific electrophysiological signatures. Monitoring these signatures can provide important information for real-time treatment adaptation, e.g. in adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, low signal to noise ratio and contamination with stimulation and physiological artifacts can challenge their clinical utility. Use of additional electrocorticography (ECoG) strips can circumvent these technical challenges, but the resulting signals are aggregated from much larger and distant neural populations, making it more challenging to extract symptoms and disease specific information.

Here, in this project we develop a deep learning framework combining spectral processing and generative diffusion models to decode deep brain activity from cortical signals, validated across 723 hours of recordings from 49 patients undergoing combined implantation of ECoG and DBS electrodes. The framework demonstrates robust performance across multiple deep brain structures (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus internus and thalamus), behavioral states (rest, sleep, movement) and brain disorders (Parkinsonâ€™s disease, dystonia, Tourette syndrome). We showcase the potential utility of reconstructing deep brain activity in clinical use cases for sleep state classification and movement detection during recording failures from DBS leads. In the future, ECoG based deep brain decoders may be used for the prediction of circuit states from deep brain areas in the absence of DBS leads including non-electrical and non-invasive deep brain stimulation.
